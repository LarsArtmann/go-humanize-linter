## Open tasks

| #   | Task                                                                                     | Tier        | Effort | Status                                                      | Evidence                                              |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| T33 | Unblock main: resolve `go 1.27.1` vs CI `go-version: "1.26"` conflict (decide + fix)     | Critical    | S      | **main CI RED since 2026-09-19**; local nix battery broken  | `go.mod:3`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, commit `b7f00c2` |
| T34 | CI guard: fail loud when go.mod `go` directive leaves the allowed range (policy in code) | High        | XS     | open — bumper struck 4×; incident #4 was never reverted     | `ci.yml` (no guard step); AGENTS.md gotcha            |
| T35 | `BenchmarkH012Detector` mirroring the H010 benchmark shape                               | Medium      | S      | open — H010 has one, H012 shipped without                   | `bench_test.go:37` (H010 precedent)                   |
| T36 | Corpus re-sweep under gogenfilter v3.6.1 (detection table may have moved)                | High        | M      | open — pin landed 2026-09-19, not re-validated              | commit `9c76bd4`; sweep loop in docs/validation       |
| T37 | `scripts/post-release-check.sh` — bounded proxy/go-get/pkg.go.dev checks                 | Medium      | M      | open — hand-polled every release so far                     | `docs/status/2026-09-19_12-08` NEXT#4                 |
| T38 | Depth-2 nested-repo sweep support (`games/KeyCountdown`-style layouts)                   | Medium      | M      | open — corpus sweeps miss nested modules                    | `docs/validation/2026-09-18_h010-sweep.md` (scope note) |
| T39 | Multi-platform release artifacts (darwin/windows/arm64; today: linux-amd64 only)         | Medium      | M      | open — carried since v0.2.0 planning                        | `.github/workflows/release.yml`; 09-02/09-09 reports  |
| T40 | Weekly self-scan + corpus-sweep ritual (CI schedule or checklist)                        | Medium      | S      | open — proposed 3×, never started; red-main drifted 5 days once | `docs/status/2026-09-18_22-01` NEXT#29           |
| T29 | H011 rule: manual SI-string parsing (ParseSI)                                            | Medium      | M      | deferred — zero corpus demand (2026-09-18 research); revisit on next upstream go-humanize tag | `rules.go` (H011 reserved); ROADMAP H011+ |

## Standing decisions (not tasks — do not re-litigate without the user)

- Declined 2026-09-19: T18 plugin-index PR, T20 gogenfilter release, branch
  protection on main, and any foreign-repo actions. Consumer repos
  (KeyCountdown, Kernovia, CreditReformBilanzampel) stay unfixed as the
  demonstration corpus.
- Go directive policy (2026-09-19): revert-on-sight for background bumps —
  see T33: incident #4 (`b7f00c2`) violated it and is the live exception.
- Baseline flags: upgrading to a release that adds rules (e.g. H010 in
  v0.3.0) adds findings — regenerate `--behavior-delta` baselines once after
  upgrading (documented in README).
